# Hackathon
# Covid-19
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION : 
 
Objective :
To understand the distribution  of data in COVID-19 Cases and perform  various data processing operations using DATA STRUCTURES concept  
 
Introduction :
World Health Organisation (WHO) has  declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.  The COVID-19 infectious disease  is fast spreading across the countries, impacting the health of large numbers of people, and thus requires immediate actions to prevent the disease at the community level across the GLOBE. 
As a Student community , it is a concern for the community as many of  our students travel across the states and countries for their project work, and internship work in future.  The result of this  RESEARCH cum Data TRENDS study of  this  Class Virtual hackathon is therefore crucial. The final outcome is aimed  towards understanding the infectious disease data pattern in the GLOBAL population such that the impact of COVID-19 has minimum effect on our students’  Project/Internship selection  planning process.  
LIMITATION  :
The result is limited to only Data  Exploration, Data observation and TRENDS. Exercise is not focusing on Forecasting or prediction modelling. 
Problem Statements 
1. Problem Statement 1:   
1. Identity the countries as HIGH RISK TRAVEL destination countries for Internship or Project work for next two years. 
Criteria for selection  :  
• Use Dataset  as Time series data. • Use confirmed cases and death  cases data. The data set is growing dynamically.  • Draw a trend graph of death growing rate for that country . The graph may change as the data set is dynamic. Collect the death growing rate (fatality or mortality). 
§ Death growing rate = Number of Deaths/ Cases Confirmed * 100 • If the death growing rate is more than 2% of the confirmed cases at any point of time, identify the country as a HIGH RISK COUNTRY. • List out the country names 
Problem Statement 2:   
2. Identity the TOP FIFTEEN(15) countries as HIGH RISK Age Group Countries for Study 
Criteria for selection  :  
• Age group to be selected between 15 to 25 ie   15 > AGE< 25. • Find out the number of people  died in that age group. • List the TOP Fifteen countries which  come under this  age group  • List the countries as HIGH RISK AGE Group COUNTRY for Studies. • Draw the plot of Age/Number of deaths (x & y axis) 
Note: These HIGH RISK COUNTRY and HIGH RISK AGE GROUP is defined only for this Academic EXERCISE purpose and do not come under any  standard guidelines  
Problem Statement 3:   
3.1 Find out the Average number of days  it took for a confirmed case to turn to a death state in any country. Which country took the maximum number of days? 
3.2  Find out the Average number of days it took a confirmed case to turn to a recovery state  in any country . Which country took the maximum number of days? 
Recommended Sites to look for Dynamic DATA SETs of COVID-19 
• John Hopkins University Site: • WHO site • Koggle • Gitub 
Select an authenticate site before finalising your data set. I  have also included few sample DATA SETS.
